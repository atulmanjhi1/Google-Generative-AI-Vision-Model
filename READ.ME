# Google Generative AI Vision Model

This Python script utilizes the Google Generative AI API to analyze an image and generate content based on it.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Google Generative AI API key
- PIL (Python Imaging Library) for image processing

## Installation

1. Install the `google.generativeai` Python package using pip:


pip install google.generativeai


2. Install PIL (Python Imaging Library) using pip if you haven't already:

pip install Pillow


3. Obtain an API key for the Google Generative AI API. You can get one from the Google Cloud Console.

## Usage

1. Run the script using Python:

python image_analysis.py


2. The script will prompt you to provide the path to the image you want to analyze. Enter the path and press Enter.

3. The script will use the Google Generative AI API to analyze the image and generate content based on it.

4. The generated content will be printed to the console.

## Configuration

Before running the script, make sure to configure the API key for the Google Generative AI API. You can do this by replacing `'YOUR_API_KEY'` with your actual API key in the `genai.configure(api_key='YOUR_API_KEY')` line of the script.

## Notes

- Ensure that your API key is kept secure and not shared publicly.
- Be mindful of the usage limits and pricing associated with the Google Generative AI API to avoid unexpected charges.
- The script requires PIL (Python Imaging Library) to process images. Make sure you have it installed.
